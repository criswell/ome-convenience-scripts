To build a working dev/build choort for the OMERO project on a Debian-derived
system, run:

       ./make_dev_chroot.sh <CHROOT_PATH>

At some point, it would be nice to add support for other distros (arch should
be pretty trivial). Might also be nice to add LXC support.

After the chroot is made, you'll likely want to use something like:
   https://bitbucket.org/criswell/chroot-wrap

to manage the chroot itself.
